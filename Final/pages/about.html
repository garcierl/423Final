    <h1>About Us</h1>
    

    <div class="aboutcontent">
       <p>Indy's Food is here to help promote the local businesses located here in Indianapolis. 
        We want our smaller local businesses to get just as much attention as the big chains 
        that exist around the country. We hope that our users will find a new place to go on 
        those Friday nights that no one wants to cook on. And we want our local businesses 
        to thrive and give tourists and locals experiences that are unique and much more memorable 
        then they would get at chain restaurants. </p>
